# Frontier String Generator

This is a WIP VSCode extension currently developed for Frontier iOS Development. This can be used to generate key-value pairs and const variables for String literals in Frontier iOS Project.

## How it works

Select a String literal you want to generate data for. Press Command + Shift + P and run the Generate Frontier String command. You'll find the generated code in new_frontier.dart and en.json.
